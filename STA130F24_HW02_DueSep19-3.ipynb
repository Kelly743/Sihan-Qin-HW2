    "    After joining this course I start who touse Chatbot as a tool to help me understand class information systematicly, Chatbot surprised me at it can solve coing problems which I didn't find it out before, there are several factor that can influenced the experience of talk with Chatbot. Positive effect countain: it help me study more effciently because I can get the correct answer more straight forward compared to using google research since google research need me to overview many websites to find the most correctly solution. Also Chatbot is more interactive due to it can remember the conversation, so I can ask questions continuously and ask question if I have anything that I don't understand derictly, where Chatbot is very good at giving detial and examples. Furthermore, Chatbot is more comperahensive base on it can solve problems in vairable areas, it is very beneficial for this course combine code that data together. But Chatbot also have negative influences where it may let me rely on it, so lost the ability of self-studing and understanding. Overall, Chatbot is an essiencial and useful tool for study this couse base on it ability of comuication."
